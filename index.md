## What is ePosition?

ePosition is a new Universal Resource Identifier(URI) that every "thing" in IoT owns an email address type of identification. Instead of @, it uses #. 

As **email** means *online mails*, **ePosition** means that the positions of "things" are connected in both on & offline.  

It is a new idea to identify "things" in the Internet of Things.

## How does ePosition name "things"?

My laptop = <b>mac#parkjiho.kr</b>

## Why is Naming Important in IoT?

As millions, billions of “things” and “humans” are being connected to the Internet together, there is no doubt that naming each object is the most important concept of this network. 

We are familiar with URLs to locate all resources in the Web. Websites have been the primary components of the Internet. Most people perceive typing in a URL on a browser as connecting to one of them.

However, IoT is different. The connected “things” are not websites but smart objects like our smartphones or cars. Would you use a URL to access your phone, your car, or your watch?
